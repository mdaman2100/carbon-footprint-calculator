                <h1>What is Carbon Footprint?</h1>
                <p>
                    A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted by a person, organization, or activity, expressed in terms of equivalent tons of CO2.
                    This includes all the emissions from electricity, transportation, manufacturing, and even from food consumption. Reducing the carbon footprint is essential to combat climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>Key Data on Carbon Emissions</h2>
                <p>
                    - The average global carbon footprint per person is about 4.8 tons of CO2 per year.<br>
                    - Industrial services, during production, contribute significantly to carbon emissions due to the energy required to power devices.<br>
                    - Shifting to renewable energy sources and optimizing industrial activities can help reduce emissions.
